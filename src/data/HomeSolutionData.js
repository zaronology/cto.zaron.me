  title: "The Expert Behind Zaronology",
  text: "For over a decade, I’ve been deep in the trenches, fixing tracking disasters, untangling broken attribution, and making sense of the messy, unreliable data that drains businesses of profit. I didn’t start out planning to build Zaronology—I built it because I was sick of watching brands make million-dollar decisions based on nothing more than guesses and bad reports.",
  text2:
    "I’ve seen businesses waste thousands of dollars a day simply because they couldn’t see the truth behind their numbers. Not because they weren’t smart. Not because they didn’t care. But because their data was lying to them.",
  text3:
    "The brands that win aren’t just spending more—they’re operating with clean, accurate, owned data that tells them exactly what’s working, what’s not, and where their next move should be.",
  text4:
    "I don’t just fix tracking—I give you control over your data so you’re no longer guessing. When you own your numbers, you can stop throwing money at problems and start investing in what actually drives revenue.",
  text5:
    "If you’re tired of second-guessing your decisions, if your numbers don’t add up, if you feel like you’re flying blind—let’s fix it. Because hope isn’t a strategy. Truth is.",
